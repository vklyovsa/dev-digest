description: "Self-review of the open local changes before a pull request is opened. Use when the user runs /pr-self-review, asks to check the changes before opening a PR, or when the PreToolUse gate refuses `gh pr create`. Collects the whole open diff (committed on the branch + uncommitted + untracked), routes every changed file onto the project skills that actually govern it — UI skills on UI files, backend/architecture skills on backend files — runs each lane, verifies every CRITICAL candidate, and writes a verdict that blocks `gh pr create` while any confirmed CRITICAL stands. Trigger terms: pr self review, самоперевірка, перед PR, before opening a PR, pre-PR check, blocked by pr-self-review."

# PR Self Review

Check the open changes against the project's own skills **before** they become a pull
request. One confirmed `CRITICAL` → the PR does not get opened.

This is not `/code-review`. That one hunts for bugs in a diff; this one checks the diff
against the conventions encoded in `.claude/skills/` and in the `CLAUDE.md` files, and it
owns the merge gate. Run both if you want both — they are deliberately separate.

## How it starts

| Path | What happens |
|---|---|
| `/pr-self-review [--base <ref>] [--scope branch\|working] [--force] [--tests]` | full run |
| `gh pr create` / `gh pr ready` | `scripts/guard-pr.sh` (PreToolUse hook) refuses with `exit 2` unless a fresh, non-blocking verdict exists |

The hook never runs the review — it only reads the artifact. When it fires, run this skill.

## Git is allowed here

This skill reads git freely (`diff`, `status`, `rev-parse`, `merge-base`, `ls-files`) —
that is its whole input. It still **writes** nothing to git: no commit, no push, no
branch, no stash, no checkout. It decides whether the user may open the PR; the user
opens it.

## Tests

Not run by default: they are slow and share the test database. Default gates are static
(`typecheck`, `arch:check`). With `--tests`, run the unit lanes of the affected packages
only — `client`: `pnpm test`, `server`: `pnpm exec vitest run --exclude '**/*.it.test.ts'`,
`reviewer-core`: `npm test`. Never the `*.it.test.ts` lane, never `e2e`.

## The run

### 0 — collect

```bash
.claude/skills/pr-self-review/scripts/collect-diff.sh --format json > /tmp/psr-files.json
```

Scope defaults to `branch` = committed against the merge-base **plus** uncommitted
**plus** untracked. `--scope working` drops the committed half. The base is `--base`, else
the branch upstream, else `origin/main`; if none resolves the script exits 3 — ask, do not
guess. Zero files → say so and stop, and write no verdict.

Report `skipped` (a file over 1500 changed lines is not reviewed) out loud. Silently
dropping it is how a CRITICAL gets missed.

### 1 — route

```bash
.claude/skills/pr-self-review/scripts/route-skills.sh > /tmp/psr-lanes.json
```

The table lives in `rules/routing.md`; the script is that table, executable. **Print the
coverage map to the user before analysing anything** — `skill → n files`, plus the
unrouted count. It is the only evidence that the lane set was derived rather than assumed.

A lane with zero files is not run. A lane that should exist and does not means
`rules/routing.md` is wrong — fix the rule, not the run.

### 2 — deterministic gates

Cheap, no model, and historically the source of most real CRITICALs. Run every gate whose
package appears in the diff:

| Gate | Command / check | Severity when it fails |
|---|---|---|
| typecheck | `cd client && pnpm typecheck` · `cd server && pnpm typecheck` · `cd reviewer-core && npm run typecheck` | CRITICAL |
| architecture | `cd server && pnpm exec depcruise src --config .dependency-cruiser.cjs` | CRITICAL |
| contract copies | a file under `*/vendor/shared/` changed in one copy only (`diff -r server/src/vendor/shared client/src/vendor/shared`) | CRITICAL |
| secrets | a key/token/`.env` value added by the diff | CRITICAL |
| migrations | `DROP TABLE` / `DROP COLUMN`, or a timestamp prefix that is not today (`date +%Y_%m_%d`) | CRITICAL / WARNING |
| lockfiles | `pnpm-lock.yaml` / `package-lock.json` changed with no `package.json` change | CRITICAL |

### 3 — lanes

One subagent per lane, up to 4 in parallel, each read-only. Give each: its
`skill_file`, its file list, the diff of those files, and the output contract from
`rules/severity.md`. A lane reports only on **its own** files and only rules from **its
own** skill. The always-on conventions lane (`rules/repo-conventions.md`) covers every
file, including the unrouted ones.

### 4 — verify

Every CRITICAL candidate is re-checked before it counts: open the file, confirm the
pattern is really there at that line, and write the failure scenario. Cannot do all
three → it is a WARNING. This is the same grounding gate `reviewer-core` applies to model
output, and it is what keeps the block trustworthy.

### 5 — verdict

Deduplicate (same file:line from two lanes = one finding, both skills credited), then:

```bash
jq -n '[ ... findings ... ]' \
  | .claude/skills/pr-self-review/scripts/write-verdict.sh \
      --base origin/main --scope branch --files 42 --skills "onion-architecture,security"
```

Writes `.claude/pr-self-review/last-run.json` (read by the hook) and `last-run.md` (a
report you can paste into the PR body). `blocked = CRITICAL > 0`. Add `--override` only
when the user explicitly said so — it is recorded in the artifact.

Then report in the chat, in Ukrainian: verdict line, coverage map, CRITICAL findings in
full (`file:line`, lane, failure scenario, fix), WARNING/SUGGESTION one line each. No
retelling of the diff.

## Bypass

`/pr-self-review --force` (writes `--override`) or `PR_SELF_REVIEW_OVERRIDE=1 gh pr create`.
Only on an explicit instruction from the user, never on your own judgement that a finding
is unimportant.

## Never

- Fix the code during the review. Report, then let the user decide; fixing mid-review
  invalidates the verdict you are about to write (the dirty hash changes).
- Edit `last-run.json` by hand — `write-verdict.sh` is the only writer.
- Lower a severity to unblock a PR. The rubric in `rules/severity.md` decides; if the
  rubric is wrong, change the rubric in its own commit.
- Run `*.it.test.ts`, e2e, migrations, or anything that touches the database.

Files: `rules/routing.md` · `rules/severity.md` · `rules/repo-conventions.md` ·
`examples.md` (what is and is not a CRITICAL here).
