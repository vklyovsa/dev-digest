# DevDigest — repository map

Local-first AI pull-request review. **Four standalone packages, not a workspace**:
each has its own `package.json` and lockfile; code is shared through tsconfig path
aliases, never through published modules.

| Folder | Package | What it is | Port |
|---|---|---|---|
| `server/` | `@devdigest/api` | Fastify 5 + Drizzle ORM / Postgres (pgvector) | 3001 |
| `client/` | `@devdigest/web` | Next.js 15 App Router + React 19 | 3000 |
| `reviewer-core/` | `@devdigest/reviewer-core` | pure engine: diff → prompt → LLM → findings | — |
| `e2e/` | `@devdigest/e2e` | deterministic browser e2e (agent-browser) | — |

Node >= 22. **`server/` and `client/` use pnpm; `reviewer-core/` and `e2e/` use npm.**
Only Postgres runs in Docker — the API and the web app run on the host.

## Commands

- Whole stack: `./scripts/dev.sh` (Postgres + API :3001 + web :3000, seeded)
- Migrations: `cd server && pnpm db:migrate` — **never applied on boot**
- Browser e2e: `./scripts/e2e.sh` — isolated stack on alternate ports
- Per-package test / typecheck commands: see that package's `CLAUDE.md`

## Read when

- Starting work inside a package → read its `CLAUDE.md` first (`server/`, `client/`,
  `reviewer-core/`, `e2e/`). Per-directory autoload is unreliable in some editors,
  so open it explicitly rather than assuming it loaded.
- You need the end-to-end picture or the architecture diagrams → `README.md`.
- Anything about test suites, the unit/integration split, or CI lanes → `TESTING.md`.
- Writing or editing a reviewer agent's system prompt → `docs/agent-prompts/`.
- The task comes from a written spec or a course lesson → `specs/`, and the
  package-level `*/specs/` for the half that lives in one package.
- Tooling or the environment behaves inexplicably → `INSIGHTS.md` (§ Recurring Errors).
- You learned something non-obvious → append it to the matching `INSIGHTS.md` section.
- Domain rules (Fastify, Drizzle, Postgres, Zod, React, Next, security) live in
  `.claude/skills/` and load on demand — do not restate them anywhere else.

## Session protocol

- **Before the first edit** in a package → read its `INSIGHTS.md` in full and say which
  entries bear on the task, or that none do. Root `INSIGHTS.md` when no package is named.
- **When a surprise resolves, and before reporting a task complete** → run the
  `engineering-insights` skill. It re-reads the file, skips what is already recorded, and
  appends; it never rewrites. Having nothing substantial to add is the normal outcome.

## Conventions

- Cross-package imports go through tsconfig path aliases, so editing
  `reviewer-core/src` breaks the server typecheck and triggers the server CI lane.
- `@devdigest/shared` (Zod contracts) exists as **two copies**:
  `server/src/vendor/shared` and `client/src/vendor/shared`. `reviewer-core`
  type-checks against the server copy. A contract change must land in both.
- CI is path-filtered per package: `.github/workflows/<package>.yml`.
- Course lessons add features as self-contained modules; the DB schema already
  contains every table, the unused ones simply sit empty.

## Naming conventions

- **Packages** — `@devdigest/<name>`; the folder is the name (`server/` is the one
  exception, `@devdigest/api`).
- **Modules** — kebab-case files (`run-executor.ts`, `diff-parser.ts`). One server
  feature is a folder: `src/modules/<name>/{routes,service,repository,helpers,constants}.ts`.
- **React** — a component is a PascalCase folder holding `<Name>.tsx`, `index.ts`
  and, when needed, `helpers.ts` / `constants.ts` / `styles.ts`. Route-local UI goes
  in `_components/<Name>/`; cross-route chrome in `client/src/components/<kebab-case>/`.
- **Tests** — `*.test.ts(x)` beside the code. DB-backed server tests MUST end in
  `*.it.test.ts`. e2e flows are `NN-name.flow.json`, written e2e specs `<slug>.spec.md`.
- **Contracts** — Zod schemas are PascalCase and the inferred type carries the same
  name (`export const PrMeta` + `export type PrMeta`).
- **Wire vs code** — JSON on the wire is snake_case (`head_sha`, `cost_usd`), TS is
  camelCase, Drizzle columns are snake_case in SQL and camelCase in TS.
- **Docs** — `specs/<feature-slug>.md`, `docs/<topic>.md`, both kebab-case.
  Migrations keep the generated `NNNN_<name>.sql` name — never renamed by hand.
- **i18n** — `client/messages/<locale>/<namespace>.json`; keys are camelCase and
  read as a dotted path (`list.columns.findings`).

## Do not touch

- **Lock-files** — `pnpm-lock.yaml` (`server/`, `client/`) and `package-lock.json`
  (`reviewer-core/`, `e2e/`) are never hand-edited: change a dependency through the
  package manager in that package and commit the lockfile it writes. There is no
  root lockfile, because this is not a workspace.
- `server/clones/**` — runtime data (git-ignored): checkouts of imported repos.
- `server/package.json` — marked `skip-worktree`; the local copy diverges from the
  committed one, which is why CI invokes vitest directly instead of via scripts.

## Gotchas

- **Never `docker compose down -v`** — the volume holds every imported repo and
  every review anyone has run locally.
- `relation ... does not exist` means migrations were not applied, not a code bug.
- Port 5432 already in use means another Postgres is running; nothing falls back.
